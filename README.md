# calculator-design
The aim of this assignment was to design hardware that would function as a simple calculator. 
This was done by determining the calculator functionality and developing appropriate RTL diagrams to implement it. 
The design was then described using Verilog. 
Verification of the design was also written in Verilog. The design was then implemented on the Digilent Nexys-4 circuit board.
